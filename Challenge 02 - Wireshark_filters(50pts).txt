Description (story-style):

Welcome, junior cyber-warrior. You’ve stepped into the web realm. Somewhere, a web server whispered a secret in plain sight.
Open the .pcap file, find the HTTP request/response, and inspect its payload. The first flag is hidden there.

Hint: Use Wireshark → Apply display filter: http → Inspect packet bytes or follow the HTTP stream.
The flag format is:

3CS{CTF-Vers.2_httpstart}
