Challenge 01 — Enter the Arena (40 pts)

Category: CTF Basics (Intro)
Desc:
Welcome, warrior 👊. This is your first CTF. A CTF (Capture The Flag) is a competition where hidden “flags” are buried in files, code, or web pages. Your mission is to discover them using logic, programming, and tools.

To warm you up:
You’ve been given a README.txt file. Somewhere inside the text, between casual words, is your very first flag.

Hint: “Always read the basics. Don’t overthink — the first flag is plain sight.”
